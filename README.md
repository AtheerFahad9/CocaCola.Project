# CocaCola.Project
Coca-Cola Sales Dashboard (USA – 2021)
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Coca-Cola’s retail performance across the U.S. in 2021. The dashboard includes:

KPIs: Total Sales ($8.68M), Total Profit ($3.17M), and Average Profit Margin (36.31%).

Brand-level analysis: Comparison of total sales, units sold, and operating profit for major beverage brands like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and others.

Geographic insights: Sales breakdown by region and state using a dynamic map segmented by U.S. regions (Midwest, South, West, etc.).

Time-based analysis: A line chart showing monthly trends in total sales and profit throughout the year.

Interactive filters: Region, retailer, and date slicers for dynamic data exploration.

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for building clear, decision-focused dashboards that support strategic insights.
